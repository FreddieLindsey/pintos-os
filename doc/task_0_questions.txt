1. git pull inside the directory if the local directory already exists.

Otherwise, git clone url where url is the url of the group's shared repository.

2. Since you do not specify the length of the source string to copy there is a possibility of overflowing the buffer reserved for the output string.

3. The default length of a time slice in ticks is 4 as defined in thread.c. In seconds it is 4 * 1/100 = 0.04 seconds.

6. In order to print a 64 bit integer the library inttypes.h must be included. In this library is the macro PRId64 which can be used with the function printf. For example
	printf("%" PRId64, i) prints the value of i where i is a 64 bit integer.
