# Pintos_OS
### An implementation of an operating system in C

#### Coding Style Conventions
This is a list of coding conventions followed by the members of the group during this project.
- In pointers declaration the asterisk should be close to the variable name rather than the type. For example:

  `int *a, *b, c;`
  
- When declaring any variable other than primitives use malloc even if they are only used in the current scope.
